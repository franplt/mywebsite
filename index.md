## Who am I?

I'm a Growth person. I like figuring out how to experiment with everything, from my workout routine to headless CMS users. On the side, I started a company with two of my best friends focused on improving people's lives by standing up to a sitting world. We launched the first wooden Standing Desk converter in Italy. Our brand, GarisendaLab, was born out of our love for made-in-Italy products, interior design and wellness. I have a genuine interest and passion for technology and its impact on us humans. I'm also obsessed with snowboarding and skiing, Ducati motorbikes and vintage bicycles. I'm a finance graduate from Bocconi University.

## My experience

I'm currently working as a Growth Product Manager at Contentful, leading a team of 5 developers to run experiments and increase activation and retention of free-tier customers.

In 2020, I co-founded GarisendaLab, a company that launched the first wooden standing desk converter in Italy. As the co-founder, I led the design, branding, marketing, and finance for the launch of our product.

Prior to joining Contentful and starting GarisendaLab I also worked as a Growth Consultant at Electric8, working with startups across Asia to help them launch new products or scale their existing growth practices.

Before that I was a Growth Product Manager at Everli (formerly Supermercato24), leading a team of 2 devs and a designer focused on customer acquisition.

I started out my career in the Philippines, as a Growth Marketing Manager and a Growth Associate at First Circle. In these roles, I managed and coached a small Growth team, spent money effectively, and started an experimentation program.

A love for numbers, listening to customers and experimentation brought me here.
